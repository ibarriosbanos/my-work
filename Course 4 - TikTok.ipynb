    "# Project Goal:\n",
    "The TikTok data team is developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content—where people can safely discover, create, and connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario:\n",
    "The TikTok data team has successfully completed exploratory data analysis on the data for the claims classification project. The team is ready to begin the process of hypothesis testing. You’ve been asked to investigate TikTok's user claim dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the claims classification project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course 4 Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Import relevant packages and TikTok data**\n",
    "2. **Explore the project data**\n",
    "3. **Implement a hypothesis test**\n",
    "4. **Communicate insights with stakeholders within TikTok**"

    "### Business Insights from the Hypothesis Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the hypothesis test indicate a **statistically significant difference** in the average video view counts, with **non-verified accounts receiving more views than verified accounts**. This is a surprising result, as one might expect verified accounts to receive more views due to their credibility. The very small p-value (8.63e-74) allows us to confidently reject the null hypothesis, confirming this observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Potential for Growth Among Non-Verified Accounts:** Non-verified accounts seem to be driving more views. This could suggest that content from everyday users, creators, or less-established accounts may resonate more with TikTok's broader audience. TikTok could explore ways to further empower non-verified creators through tools, visibility, or incentivizing content creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Audience Preference for Non-Verified Content:** The platform's users might prefer the content from non-verified accounts, possibly because it feels more authentic, grassroots, or relatable. TikTok could capitalize on this by highlighting the diversity and authenticity of non-verified creators.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Re-evaluating the Role of Verified Accounts:** The lower view count for verified accounts could indicate that the verified badge doesn't necessarily translate to higher engagement or that these accounts may focus more on niche audiences. TikTok may need to reassess how it promotes verified users and ensure their content reaches the intended audience more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content and Algorithm Strategy:** These insights could prompt TikTok to adjust its recommendation algorithms, ensuring a balance between promoting content from verified and non-verified accounts to maintain platform diversity while engaging a broader audience.\n"
